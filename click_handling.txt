1. Set up the handlers I want, rather that try to decode them
   after the fact. This would be done by looking at the elements
   under the "div" for the table and assigning onclicks. Use
   addEventListener(). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener

  a. For column:
    1) Look for <head> tag
    2) For each <th>,
       extract from <th> id the name of the column ("yui-dt*-th-"[name])
  b. For Cell
    1) Find the <td tag with yui-dt-data
    2) Keep track of index by row and table
    3) Add click event with data provided by row and column
  c. For Row
    1) If first column, extract the row# and treat as a row event
       for right click
    2) Otherwise, ignore the event
   
  

2. If deciphering clicks, then need to backup to parent. Look
