0. See if YUI will work for my needs
  -STATUS
   Got context menu with cell editing
   Trying to get separate events for context for tbl and col
  -ISSUES
   1. CSS is wrong
   2. Not getting the right DOM element for the tbl event
  -TO DO:
   1. Need to find right DOM for table
   2. Fix CSS
   3. Show can communicate with server
  c. Trying to get context menu for columns, but have dependency errors.
     Combining InlineEdit and ContextMenu

0.1 Approach
  a. Context menu for header is created by knowing the id of the tags
     which can be obtained from a DOM search
  b. Need to merge constructing context menu with cell inline editing

1. Single table
-.css uses URLs instead of images/static for drop-down for menus
-Trying to get a form that comes up dynamically when select a button.
 as an alernative, can send request to server, which comes back with the form.
  The response can include the table.

1.1 Demonsrate ability to embed multiple lines. (Can embed html using a column formatter).
2. js + html
  a. Use example-plugin-headermenu as start (or context menu in http://localhost:8000/SlickGrid/examples/example7-events.html)
  b. Add
     editing (from example 3), including handling notifications of changes (e.g., via ajax?)
  c. Column Header menu
        insert left 
        insert right
        delete
        cut
        paste left
        past right
2.1 HTMLTable
   generate the data and headers

3. Tests
   a. Display unnested random table
   b. Do nested random table

4. Export to python - 4 files: function.py, test_function.py, 
   input.dat, output.dat. test_function runs function.py with
   input.dat and verifies that output.dat is produced.

5. Can I do an import if write functions as methods in a special
   class? That way, python import of function.py will provide
   the right metadata.
