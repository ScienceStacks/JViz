Serve page from Django

a. Bug in scisheets processing. Need better tests for ui_table
   to simulate processing of commands
   (a) Need to mock page reloads for click handlers
   (b) ajax mock isn't working correctly
   (c) bug was that table Id must be the same as the name
       of the div in which the table is placed, "scitable"

a.1 Consider changing row_index on command submission to row_name

b. javascript tests
-- Not getting the data instantiated but can't determine where the
   problem is. The correct variables appear to be instantiated
   in table_setup.js. But the DOM objects aren't created.

1. Implement processing for a data cell update
   a. Why am I getting "pickle.p"
   a. Provide tests for js & python new code

1.1 Implement column delete.
   a. Command is sent to delete the column
   b. Success function causes the page to be reloaded.

2. Provide for updates to tables
  a. values - ajax interface to change values, retain table between calls
  b. columns
  c. rows

3. Implement ITERATE function

3. Tests
   a. Display unnested random table
   b. Do nested random table

4. Export to python - 4 files: function.py, test_function.py, 
   input.dat, output.dat. test_function runs function.py with
   input.dat and verifies that output.dat is produced.

5. Can I do an import if write functions as methods in a special
   class? That way, python import of function.py will provide
   the right metadata.
