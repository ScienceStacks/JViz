Serve page from Django

1. Column Move
  - Server code (needs destination column name)
    Test for invalid column and the data returned
  - JS codes (simple like Row) - requires inputting the dest. name
    Handle invalid column; need prompt for column name of move pos

1.5 Implement
  -Column Move>Before/After (select column/row)
  -AddNew>Before/After (column/row)
  -clickMenuTester - checks for child nodes
  -cut and paste for column and rows?

2. Formula

Fixes:

1. Getting lots of CSS errors. Properties Alpha and touch-action aren't defined.

2. Qunit tests run in batch don't work for click simulation (but
   running the tests in the browser works if you open the
   test.html).

3. consistent use of scitable, scisheet, scisheets

4. Get rid of mockjax (not included in code)

New feature

1. Row rename
  Need py to move and renumber the rows

2. Row insert
  Handle None correctly for values in new row

3. Column formula (just update context)


b. javascript tests
-- Not getting the data instantiated but can't determine where the
   problem is. The correct variables appear to be instantiated
   in table_setup.js. But the DOM objects aren't created.

1. Implement processing for a data cell update
   a. Why am I getting "pickle.p"
   a. Provide tests for js & python new code

1.1 Implement column delete.
   a. Command is sent to delete the column
   b. Success function causes the page to be reloaded.

2. Provide for updates to tables
  a. values - ajax interface to change values, retain table between calls
  b. columns
  c. rows

3. Implement ITERATE function

3. Tests
   a. Display unnested random table
   b. Do nested random table

4. Export to python - 4 files: function.py, test_function.py, 
   input.dat, output.dat. test_function runs function.py with
   input.dat and verifies that output.dat is produced.

5. Can I do an import if write functions as methods in a special
   class? That way, python import of function.py will provide
   the right metadata.
