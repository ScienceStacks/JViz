Serve page from Django
-Refactored but missing the images directory under jquery-ui
-isolate data

To Fix
1. images: change the "url" references (via sed) and:
a) Use https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.4/images/
b) use a static path that works
c) change the .css .js files to be templates
d) Use static files correctly, as in https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.4/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png
2. Clicking on row only has menu for insert or change row number
3. Problem with menu selections being hidden when click table caption
4. Make tests work

1. Single table
-.css uses URLs instead of images/static for drop-down for menus
-Trying to get a form that comes up dynamically when select a button.
 as an alernative, can send request to server, which comes back with the form.
  The response can include the table.

1.1 Demonsrate ability to embed multiple lines. (Can embed html using a column formatter).
2. js + html
  a. Use example-plugin-headermenu as start (or context menu in http://localhost:8000/SlickGrid/examples/example7-events.html)
  b. Add
     editing (from example 3), including handling notifications of changes (e.g., via ajax?)
  c. Column Header menu
        insert left 
        insert right
        delete
        cut
        paste left
        past right
2.1 HTMLTable
   generate the data and headers

3. Tests
   a. Display unnested random table
   b. Do nested random table

4. Export to python - 4 files: function.py, test_function.py, 
   input.dat, output.dat. test_function runs function.py with
   input.dat and verifies that output.dat is produced.

5. Can I do an import if write functions as methods in a special
   class? That way, python import of function.py will provide
   the right metadata.
