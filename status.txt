Serve page from Django

Not handling cell update events correctly. There are two events:
  mouse click
  editsave
Have confounded this. Symptoms:
 -Get multiple messages in CellClick
 -Not send ajax to server to update the table

Getting lots of CSS errors. Properties Alpha and touch-action aren't defined.

Need tests for added python and javascript

Not getting accurate column index. Use column name in pre tag?

rename sctiable.css to scisheets.css

a.0 Implement rename column
 (1) Completed server side: accepts argument list. Processes Rename command.
 (2) Client side has a fixed name that is coded in column_event.js. Need a dialog.
     Look at jqueryui - https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form

a.1 Consider changing row_index on command submission to row_name

a.2 Get rid of mockjax

b. javascript tests
-- Not getting the data instantiated but can't determine where the
   problem is. The correct variables appear to be instantiated
   in table_setup.js. But the DOM objects aren't created.

1. Implement processing for a data cell update
   a. Why am I getting "pickle.p"
   a. Provide tests for js & python new code

1.1 Implement column delete.
   a. Command is sent to delete the column
   b. Success function causes the page to be reloaded.

2. Provide for updates to tables
  a. values - ajax interface to change values, retain table between calls
  b. columns
  c. rows

3. Implement ITERATE function

3. Tests
   a. Display unnested random table
   b. Do nested random table

4. Export to python - 4 files: function.py, test_function.py, 
   input.dat, output.dat. test_function runs function.py with
   input.dat and verifies that output.dat is produced.

5. Can I do an import if write functions as methods in a special
   class? That way, python import of function.py will provide
   the right metadata.
